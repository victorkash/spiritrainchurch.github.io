                            <p>One of the most urgent messages for the church in this generation is the reality of the catching up of believers. The Bible calls us to watch and pray, for we do not know the day or the hour when Christ shall come in the air to gather His saints. Jesus Himself said:</p>
                            <p class="scripture"><strong>“Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come” (Matthew 24:42).</strong></p>
                            <p>This truth is not a distant doctrine but a living hope that shapes the daily walk of every believer.</p>

                            <h2 class="text-indigo-600">The Meaning of “Catching Up”</h2>
                            <p>The phrase “caught up” appears in 1 Thessalonians 4:17, where Paul writes:</p>
                            <p class="scripture"><strong>“Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air…”</strong></p>
                            <p>The Greek word here is harpazo, which means to seize suddenly, to snatch away with force. The Latin translation rendered it rapturo, from which we get the English word Rapture. Though “rapture” itself is not found in our English Bibles, the truth of it is deeply scriptural: the sudden, supernatural removal of believers from earth to meet Christ in the air.</p>
                        </section>

                        <section class="card">
                            <h2 class="text-indigo-600">Those Who Have Been Caught Up Before</h2>
                            <p>Scripture gives us patterns—living testimonies—that the catching up is real and possible:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Enoch – “And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him” (Genesis 5:24). A life of fellowship with God ended in a sudden translation without death.</li>
                                <li>Elijah – Taken by a whirlwind into heaven with a chariot of fire (2 Kings 2:11).</li>
                                <li>Christ Jesus – The risen Lord ascended into heaven in the sight of His disciples (Acts 1:9–11), the firstfruits of all who will follow in His resurrection power.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These examples remind us that the Rapture is not fantasy but the continuation of God’s proven pattern of lifting His own into glory.</p>
                        </section>

                        <section class="card">
                            <h2 class="text-indigo-600">The Power of Resurrection in Christ</h2>
                            <p>The foundation of our hope is the resurrection of Jesus Christ. His triumph over death guarantees our triumph. Paul declares:</p>
                            <p class="scripture"><strong>“If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he… shall also quicken your mortal bodies” (Romans 8:11).</strong></p>
                            <p>This same resurrection power is alive in every believer today. It sanctifies our living, strengthens our faith, and prepares us for that glorious day when the dead in Christ shall rise first, and the living saints shall be transformed in an instant.</p>

                            <p>The catching up leads believers into two glorious events:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The Marriage Supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:7–9) – the eternal union of Christ and His Bride, the Church, in unbroken fellowship and joy.</li>
                                <li>The Bema Seat of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:10) – where saints are rewarded for their works of faith, love, and obedience.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>These are not fears for the believer, but promises that stir our hearts to holy living and faithful service.</p>

                            <p>Every believer must hold fast the assurance of faith. The catching up is not for the doubter or the casual hearer but for those who live in hope, faith, and readiness. Paul called it “the blessed hope” (Titus 2:13).</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Faith in Christ Alone – Salvation by grace through faith is the foundation. Without Christ, there is no hope of catching up.</li>
                                <li>Holiness of Life – “Without holiness no man shall see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14). Purity of heart and obedience in daily living keep us watchful.</li>
                                <li>Spirit-Filled Walk – The wise virgins kept oil in their lamps (Matthew 25:1–13). Be full of the Holy Spirit to discern and endure.</li>
                                <li>Love and Service – The Rapture-ready believer lives in love, forgiveness, and service to others. Faith works through love (Galatians 5:6).</li>
                                <li>Prayerful Watchfulness – “Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy…” (Luke 21:36). Constant communion with God keeps us awake and prepared.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>The catching up is imminent. No prophecy needs to be fulfilled before it takes place. The trumpet could sound at any moment. The most important question is not when Christ will come, but are you ready?</p>

                                <p class="text-gray-700">By Pastor Israel Emmanuel</p>
                            </div>

                        <section class="card lead">
                            <p>“Have you ever had your phone freeze or glitch so badly that no matter what button you press, it just won’t work? Sometimes, the only way to fix it is not just to charge it, not just to update it, but to do a factory reset. That’s what it means to be born again—God gives us a total reset on the inside!”</p>
                            <p>The Bible says in Romans 3:23: “All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.”</p>
                            <p>Sin is like a virus in our hearts. It makes us selfish, disobedient, and separated from God.</p>
                            <p>The “new world order” we see today is like a big advertisement saying, “You can fix yourself without God! Just upgrade your phone, change your looks, or follow trends.”</p>
                            <p>But no matter how many “updates” we download from culture, sin still corrupts the heart.</p>
                            <p>Illustration: Imagine painting over a broken screen—it might look nice outside, but the phone still doesn’t work. That’s the old life without Jesus.</p>
                            <p>Jesus said in John 3:3: “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”</p>
                            <p>Being born again isn’t about starting over in the same old life; it’s about receiving a brand-new life from God.</p>
                            <p>2 Corinthians 5:17: “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”</p>
                            <p>When we receive Jesus, God doesn’t just patch us up. He puts His Spirit inside us—a brand-new operating system!</p>
                            <p>Illustration: Think of trading in a broken phone for a brand-new one straight from the manufacturer. That’s what God does for us through Jesus.</p>

                            <p>In the “new world order,” people want unity without God. But in the new creation, God unites people of all races and civilizations through His Spirit.</p>
                            <p>Being born again gives us:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A new identity – children of God (John 1:12).</li>
                                <li>A new heart – with God’s love written inside (Ezekiel 36:26).</li>
                                <li>A new future – eternal life with Christ (John 3:16).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This is not a trend, it’s eternal truth.</p>
                            <p>Illustration: Imagine everyone trying to wear the same brand of shoes to fit in—that’s culture’s “new world order.” But God says, “I’ll give you wings instead of shoes, so you can soar where no one else can walk.”</p>

                            <p>Being born again is God’s ultimate reset—better than any trend or system the world can offer. In Christ, you’re not patched up, you’re made brand-new!</p>

                                <li>Sin is a glory stealer and killer. God told Adam that the day he eats the forbidden fruit, he will surely die. Spirit life from God was disconnected and discontinued. <span class="refs">(Genesis 2:16–17; Romans 8:1; Ephesians 2:1)</span></li>
